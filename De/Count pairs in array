Count pairs of given array, it follows the formula a + nk = b
Return numbers of pairs (a,b). Don't need to care about order of a and b (a,b) = (b,a)

Example 1:
- Input:  [1,3,5,2,4,7]; k = 2
- Output: 7 => (1,3), (1,5), (1,7), (3,5), (3,7), (2,4), (5,7)

Example 2:
- Input: [1,1,1,2]; k = 1
- Output: 1 => (1,2)

Example 3:
- Input: [1], k = 1
- Output: 0
